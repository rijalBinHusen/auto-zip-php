# Auto zip all files and folders
The directory of this project is as below:

```
├── folder1
|   └── folder1_file1.txt
|   └── folder_1_file2.txt
├── folder2
|   ├── folder2_file1.txt
|   └── folder2_file2.txt
├── .gitignore
├── file1.txt
├── file2.txt
├── index.php
└── readme.MD
```

All files and folders will be included in 1 zip file with directory tree like that too :)
